Part 1

//Display deck of cards, one at a time
//When page loads, , fetch API to create a new deck
//Add button that will let you draw a cards
//there is a limit of cards
//if all cards have been drawned, show alert message text “Error: no cards remaining!”.

Components

- Deck
    //Render div that will represent the "Deck" and "draw" button
        *this component will have useState(card, setCard)

    //Fetch API once page loads. 
            *this will require the useEffect()

   
       

- Cards:
        //When draw is clicked:
                * creat a  new div that will be after the previous (will use an array)
                *Update state: add num of cards = 1
    * Previos card needs to be referenced nd new card shows on top
     * If num of card === X show alert and render new button called "new deck"
            **this will shuffle the deck (maybe needs useRef())

            //useRef-Id
